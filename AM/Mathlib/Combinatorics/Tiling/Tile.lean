# Tiles for tilings

This file defines some basic concepts related to individual tiles for tilings in a discrete
context (with definitions in a continuous context to be developed separately but analogously).

Work in the field of tilings does not generally try to define or state things in any kind of
maximal generality, so it is necessary to adapt definitions and statements from the literature
to produce something that seems appropriately general for mathlib, covering a wide range of
tiling-related concepts found in the literature. Nevertheless, further generalization may prove
of use as this work is extended in future.

We work in the context of a space `X` acted on by a group `G`; the action is not required to be
faithful, although typically it is. In a discrete context, tiles are expected to cover the space,
or a subset of it being tiled when working with tilings not of the whole space, and the tiles are
pairwise disjoint. In a continuous context, definitions in the literature vary; the tiles may be
closed and cover the space with interiors may be required to be disjoint (as used by Grünbaum and
Shephard or Goodman-Strauss), or they may be required to be measurable and to partition it up to
null sets (as used by Greenfeld and Tao).

In general we are concerned not with a tiling in isolation but with tilings by some protoset of
tiles; thus we make definitions in the context of such a protoset, where copies of the tiles in
the tiling must be images of those tiles under the action of an element of the given group.

Where there are matching rules that say what combinations of tiles are considered as valid, these
are provided as separate hypotheses where required. Tiles in a protoset are commonly considered
in the literature to be marked in some way. When this is simply to distinguish two otherwise
identical tiles, this is represented by the use of different indices in the protoset. When this
is to give a file fewer symmetries than it would otherwise have under the action of the given
group, this is represented by the symmetries specified in the `Prototile` being less than its
full stabilizer.

The group `G` is throughout here a multiplicative group. Additive groups are also used in the
literature, typically when based on `ℤ`; when working with the definitions here, such cases are
expected to be handled by working with a group such as `Fin n → Multiplicative ℤ`.

## Main definitions

* `Prototile G X`: A prototile in `X` as acted on by `G`, carrying the information of a subgroup
  of the stabilizer that says when two copies of the prototile are considered the same.

* `Protoset G X ιₚ`: An indexed family of prototiles.

* `PlacedTile ps`: An image of a tile in the protoset `ps`.
